# nameplateGenerator

## The problem this solves:

At work the doors had nameplates on the doors showing who had offices there.  At some point shortly before I started working there, there was a change in personnel and the knowledge of who to ask to get them for new hires was lost.  I eventually got myself a personal compact CNC machine and realized I could engrave my own.  So I made a few for my team and management learned about it and paid me some money to order materials for the rest of the building.  Before I would have just done them on my own one at a time but now I have 30+ to do.  So I automated a script to modify a template file with the new name to input, then figure out the width of the new text, then figure out the new location to put the text, then it applies a hershey text modification to turn it into single line for engraving.
